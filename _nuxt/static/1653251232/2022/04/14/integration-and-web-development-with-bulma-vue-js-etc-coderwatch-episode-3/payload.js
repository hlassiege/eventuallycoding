Ant and it offers a standardized build. Ant allows you to do everything with a lot of flexibility (like Gradle today?) but at the expense of standardization.\n\nWhen a dev goes from one maven project to another, even with several versions apart, he is always confortable. He don't have to learn a lot. \n\nFrom my perspective, with a novice eye, JavaScript suffers from having very powerful tools, but too numerous, with rising versions which very often are not compatible, with so much flexibility that it becomes very complex to find the right configuration at the beginning but above all it is a hell to evolve.\n\nPositive personal record in Web integration\n\nI probably wouldn't have said that a few years ago, but in the end I really enjoyed this HTML\u002FCSS integration phase.\n\nI learned a lot about the flexbox system, about clippaths, about the modularization of my components, CSS animations, positioning etc… \n\nThis step lasted about a week (still in evening and weekend mode) for about twenty pages. At the end of this week I felt much more comfortable and I wanted to progress more. \n\nIf we forget the tooling, it was really fun to work on this part, to build pages and funnel and to gradually see the result appear.\n\nNumbers of the week on Coderwatch\n\nThe official launch was 2 weeks ago. The player count is 33 and I saw an increase that day with the first article in this series. However, the rate of new users is quite low (and 99% are in France).\n\n\n\nThe number of quizzes played is 39, which implies that several players have played only once without returning. \n\nNo user came via referral and only 3 questions were created by players.\n\nIn short, for the moment the game has attracted almost only curious followers and we cannot say that it has found its product market fit. \n\nBut it is certainly not at this stage that we should give up, the reverse would have been a surprise. \n\nThree users gave me precise and interesting feedback on their journeys and I note a few limiting elements to properly introduce the game in the first moments of registration. \n\nThe question I'm going to have to decide from now on is: should I focus on improving the game to turn current users into regular players and get them to promote it, or do I need to focus on gaining traffic. \n\nWait and see.\n\nThanks for reading me so far. Next week I'll be at Devoxx giving a talk on tech impact, leadership and careers_Senior_avec_6_ans_d%E2%80%99experience,et_apres%3F) so I probably won't write any posts. But the next post in this series will focus on Backend dev.\n\nSee you soon\n",readTime:{text:"7 min read",minutes:6.945,time:416700,words:1389}},relatedArticles:[{slug:"coderwatch-episode-2-design-with-figma-and-procreate",description:"Here is the second post of this serie around the creation of a side project. \nIf you haven't read the first one, my goal is to make a mini series ret...",id:"2021",title:"Coderwatch: Episode 2 – Design with Figma and Procreate",date:"2022-04-08",tags:[v,r],img:"pasted-image-0-5.png",cover:"cover8.jpg",path:"\u002Farticles\u002F2022\u002F04\u002F08\u002Fcoderwatch-episode-2-design-with-figma-and-procreate"},{slug:"on-vend-une-competence-pas-un-lieu",description:"Récemment j'ai eu un échange sur Twitter qui m'a interloqué (interloquer ça fait classe).
